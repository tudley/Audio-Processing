# Audio-Processing
A repo to handle my project to process audio. Potential future is to implement np.fft function to identify a sound and classify it as a not based on the main frequencies, input audio data from a microphone, potentially create a 'karaoke' game using these concepts, create a software equivalent of Rolands' SP404-X
